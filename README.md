# Object State Exercise

## How to solve this Exercise

Start with `object_state01.rb`:

```bash
$ ruby object_state01.rb
```

This will return:

```
Run options: --seed 12567

# Running:

E

Finished in 0.000453s, 2206.6093 runs/s, 0.0000 assertions/s.

  1) Error:
ObjectStateTest#test_01:
NameError: uninitialized constant ObjectStateTest::Character
    object_state01.rb:19:in `test_01'

1 runs, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 1 errors, 0 skips
```

So now make this test pass by implementing a `Character` class above the test.
Only write the code that is **necessary to make the test pass**, nothing more!

After that, continue with number `02`, `03` and so on.

```bash
$ ruby object_state02.rb
$ ruby object_state03.rb
$ ruby object_state04.rb
$ ruby object_state05.rb
```

After each exercise, you
may check the solutions (in the `solutions` folder) and compare.

**Try not to just jump into the solutions, really think about the solutions and also ask your coaches questions.**

Ask the coaches if you have any questions.
