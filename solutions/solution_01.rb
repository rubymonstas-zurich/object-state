# Solution:

class Character
end

# Explanation:
#
# This is the simplest class implementation we can create. It simply
# creates a new Character class that has no methods and no constructor.
# The only thing you can do with it is create a new character object:

my_character = Character.new

# and nothing more. Not very useful, but still something that's valid in Ruby.
